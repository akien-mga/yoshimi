data to send from gui

Chars are unsigned. Set unused ones to 0xff as a general test.

e.g.
if part is 0xf0 (main) and kit is 0xff you're there and it
is main volume, key shift etc.

part is 0xf1 for system effects.
part is 0xf2 for insertion effects

if part is < 0x40 and kit is 0xff it's the general part
level controls.
If kit < 0x10 and engine is  0xff it's the engine enable controls (kit number | engine)

Type bits
0-4 event button (action to take)
5   source is GUI (else bits 0-4 = source & action)
6   read/write data value
7   round to int (will be sent as float)


Effetcs are special kit numbers offset by 0x80.
They can't be inserts, as Dynefilter has Filter as an insert!

            0 = Amplitude
            1 = Frequency
            2 = Filter
