Consider, Pitchwheel split range in Controllers, but that one seems
a bit pointless to me!


Change root/bank/instrument lists to single file for all instances.

Make loading effect presets update the 'top' line.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved.
    size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Allow headless compilation.

Make add/pad windows show kit number.

Make attempt to start second independent instance open a new one in running yoshimi instead - saves memory and more consistent.

Add scales control to CLI.

Make things like LFOs either floats or much higher resolution.

LFO frequency should be stated in Hz.
Ampitude LFO depth should be in %
Frequency LFO depth should be in cents.

Consider filter settings too.


RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Maybe a NRPN variation of this for global fine tuning.


Review tooltips.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

Consider scroll wheel control of sliders.

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
