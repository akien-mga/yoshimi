This started out as a means of exposing various controls to NRPNs but proved to be so useful it became considerably expanded and shared by all sorts of inputs.

Many of the commands produce log output in a manner designed to be compatible with both the GUI reports window and with a CLI readline environment.

There are two integer parameters passed in:
type    obvious!
value   the purpose (if any) dependent on the actual function called.

Type:
   2    value = master key shift

   7    value = master volume

64-79   type = channel number (+ 64) value = keyshift

100     value = reports destination

101     value > 63 = enable load default state

102     value > 63 = enable instrument load time display

103     value > 63 = hide non-fatal error reports

106     value = line number to find text of midi-learn history

107     value = list size for list current midi learn list

108     list all vector parameters

109     list current main settings

110     list file paths

111     value = root number who's banks this will list

112     value = bank number who's instruments this will list

113     value = root ID to be set as 'current'

114     value = bank ID to be set as 'current' (in current root)

115     value = number for program change

116     value > 63 = enable program change

117     value > 63 = enable extended program change

118     value = number of parts to be made available (16, 32, 64)

119     save current settings

128     value = part number for channel switch (dependent on switch type)
