Using NRPNs Yoshi can now directly set some part values regardless of what channel that part is connected to.

Set NRPN
 MSB = 64 {same as for vectors}, LSB = 0  [8128]

then (all value ranges start from zero, not 1)

Data MSB (6)
    0 : data LSB = part number          {this obviously has to be set first}
    1 : data LSB = program number
    2 : data LSB = controller number    {carried over between calls}
    3 : data LSB = controller value
    4 : data LSB = part's channel number { 16 - 31 only allows note off for this part
                                           > 31 disconnects the part from all channel messages}
    5 : data LSB = part's audio destination
                    1 = main L&R
                    2 = direct L&R
                    3 = both
                    all other values ignored


   35 (0x23) : data LSB = controller LSB value {not yet implemented}

   64 (0x40) : data LSB = key shift value      { 64 = no shift}

Other values currently ignored.
