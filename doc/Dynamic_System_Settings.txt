If Yoshimi has been started from the command line, all of the system setting that don't require a restart can now be viewed by sending the appropriate NRPN. Most of them can also be changed in this way.

Please also refer to command line.

To access this, set NRPN MSB (CC 99) to 64 and NRPN LSB (CC 98) to 2 [8130]

After that send the following DATA values. Commands with LSB x don't actually use DATA LSB but you still need to send it (unless it has already been set by a previous command in this control group).

DATA
MSB

  2 LSB key         Set master key shift {28 <= key <= 100} (-36 to + 36)
  7 LSB volume      Set master Volume {volume}

  64 - 79 LSB key   Set channel (n - 64) key shift

100 LSB > 63        Send reports to Reports window, otherwise to stderr.

108 LSB x  [13824]  List settings of all vectors.

109 LSB x  [13843]  List the following:
                    Reports destination
                    Current Root path
                    Current Bank
                    CC to control Root path change
                    CC to control Bank change
                    Accept Program change {enabled/disabled}
                    Activate part when program changed {enabled/disabled}
                    CC to control Extended Program change {instruments 127 to 159}
                    Number of available parts

110 LSB x  [13970]  List all root paths
111 LSB path        List all banks in Root ID {path}
           [14224]  {path = 127 for current root}
112 LSB bank        List all instruments in current root, bank ID {bank}
           [14351]  {bank = 127 for current bank in current root}

113 LSB root        Set CC to control Root path change {root > 119 disables}
114 LSB bank        Set CC to control Bank change {bank > 119 disables}
115 LSB > 63        Enable Program change otherwise disable
116 LSB > 63        Enable activation of part when program changed
117 LSB extprog     Set CC control Extended program change {extprog > 119 disables}
118 LSB parts       Set number of available parts {parts = 16, 32 or 64}

119 LSB x  [15113]  Save all dynamic settings
