When running from the command line, once the 'up and running' message has been seen much of Yoshimi can be controlled here.

Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will return a message that attempts to highlight the problem.

There are a group of commands that are always available. These are

? (Help)
List
RESet
EXit

Apart from these, the command line works on a system of context levels, and normally only the commands relevant to that level will be available.

Often you only need the first letter of a command - as long as it is unabiguous. The above examples show their minimum abbreviations in capitals. However, Yoshimi is quite pedantic, and if you type the command in full it must be exactly correct!

All number ranges start from zero. This is different from the gui where most (but not all) start from one. So CLI part 0 is GUI part 1, but CLI bank 0 is GUI bank 0.

The prompt will always show what level you are on along with relevant information. You will also get a confirmation message after each command, but - for clarity - those are not included in the examples below.

Starting from the prompt: yoshimi >

Enter:

"s p 2 pr 107"

and the prompt will change to:

yoshimi part 2 on >

This will set part number 2 to program number 107 from the current instrument bank.

You are now on part 2 as the current part and all commands will now relate to this. At this level you can change the current part simply with:

"s 4"
yoshimi part 4 off >

You are now on part number 4, but that part is currently disabled.

"s ef ty re"
yoshimi part 4 off FX 0 REver-0 >

Sets the part's effect 0 to type 'reverb'

Even thogh the part is disabled you can still set up its chnaraxcteristics. Also, notice the two capitals in reverb, these remind you of the minimum abbreviation.

Many settings are optional and if you omit them, either a default, or last used, value will be assumed. Also names are truncated to 5 characters so the prompt line doesn't get unmanageably long.


From here you can set a preset for this effect:

"s pre 3"

yoshimi part 4 off FX 0 REver-3 >

Currently the presets are shown only numerically in the prompt.

from the top leveve, settings that follow in a direct line through several levels can be made all at once and you will be left at the appropriate level:

"s p 5 ef 2 ty re"
yoshimi part 5 off FX 2 REver-0 >

You can't combine type and preset as they are both at the same level.

To go back one level:

".."
yoshimi part 5 off>

and to go back to the top:

"/"
yoshimi >

These last can also be put on the front of any other command.
Starting where we were before:

yoshimi part 4 off FX 2 REver-3 >
" ..s vol 70"
yoshimi part 4 off>

part 4 volume is now at 70, and you are once again at part level, not part FX level.


The help menus and lists are also partially context sensitive. This should help avoid clutter and confusion.

As well as an immediate history Yoshimi maintains a command history file, so provided you make a normal command line exit your last commands will be available on your next run.


Originally this file contained the currently implemented commands, but as this is very much a moving target, it is simpler to just ask you to run Yoshimi and type "?"

Commands with '*' in the description need the setup to be saved, and Yoshimi restarted to be activated.

More will be added, and the organisation of them may be changed slightly.

If any configuration settings are changed, either here or in the gui, you will be given a warning when you exit, with the option to continue running so you can save the changes.
