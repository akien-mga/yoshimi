When running from the command line, once the 'up and running' message has been seen much of Yoshimi can be controlled here.

There are a group of commands that are always available. These are 

? (Help)
List
RESet
EXit

Apart from these, the command line works on a system of context levels, and normally only the commands relevant to that level will be available. 

Commands are not case sensitive and an invalid one will print a reminder. Often you only need the first letter of a command - as long as it is unabiguous. The above examples show their minimum abbreviations in capitals. However, Yoshimi is quite pedantic, and if you type the command in full it must be exactly correct!

All number ranges start from zero. This is different from the gui where most (but not all) start from one. So CL part 0 is gui part 1, but CL bank 0 is gui bank 0.

The prompt will always show what level you are on along with relevant information. You will also get a confirmation message, but - for clarity - those are not included in the examples below.

Starting from the yoshimi > prompt:

"s p 2 pr 107"
yoshimi part 2 >

This will set part number 2 to program number 107 from the current instrument bank.

You are now on part 2 as the current part and all commands relate to this. At this level you can change the current part simply with:

"s 4"
yoshimi part 4 >

You are now on part number 4.

"s ef ty re"
yoshimi part 4 FX 0 rever >

Sets the part's effect 0 to type 'reverb'

Note that many settings are optional and if you ommit them, either a default or last used value will be assumed. Also names are truncated to 5 characters so the prompt line doesn't get unmanageably long.

From here you can set a preset for this effect:

"s pre 3"

Currently the presets are not shown in the prompt , but you will get a confirmation message.

Settings that follow in a direct line can be made all at once and you will be left at the appropriate level:

"s p 4 ef 2 ty re"
yoshimi part 4 FX 2 rever >

You can't combine type and preset as thay are both at the same level.

To go back one level:

".."
yoshimi part 4 >

and to go back to the top:

"/"
yoshimi >

These last can also be put on the front of any other command.
Starting where we were before:

yoshimi part 4 FX 2 rever >
" ..s vol 70"
yoshimi part 4 >

part 4 volume is now at 70, and you are once again at part level, not part FX level.


The help menus and lists are also partially context sensitive. This should help avoid clutter and confusion.

As well as an immediate history Yoshimi maintains a command history file, so provided you make a normal command line exit your last commands will be available on your next run.


Originally this file contained the currently implemented commands, but as this is very much a moving target, it is simpler to just ask you to run Yoshimi and type "?"

Commands with '*' in the description need the setup to be saved, and Yoshimi restarted to be activated. 

More will be added, and the organisation of them may be changed slightly.

If any configuratiion settings are changed, either here or in the gui, you will be given a warning when you exit, with the option to continue running so you can save the changes.
