On first run of Yoshimi there is one config path per user regardless of how yoshimi is obtained, and it is:

/home/{user}/.config/yoshimi/

A distro install will have one default bank root at:

/usr/share/yoshimi/banks/

It will usually be given an ID of 5.

A self build and install will have two default bank roots:

/usr/share/local/yoshimi/banks/
/home/{user}/{buildpath}/banks/

Adding new roots is a two stage process.

First you use your normal filer controls to create the root (or import one from somewhere)

/home/{user}/newroot/banks/

It doesn't actually have to be banks, but traditionally we've always done this.

Next, in Yoshimi:

add r /home/{user}/newroot/banks/

It will report the ID it gave, but won't actually make it current. Later you can change this ID between 0 and 127 provided it isn't already in use. We don't recommend ID 0 as some sequencers try to change to this on every program change. Yoshimi will not respond to unused IDs and never changes them by itself.
