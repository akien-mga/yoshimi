These files are loosely organised info that will eventually be turned into proper documentation.

Any additional notes are more than welcome. If you like, you can send them to me at:

For the sake of completeness in the Histories directory there is some info on ZynAddSubFx from its beginning up to the time of the Yoshimi fork. Other information is being placed there from time to time.
