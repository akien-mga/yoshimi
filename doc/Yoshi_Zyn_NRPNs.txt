Yoshimi now implements System and Insertion effects control in a manner compatible with ZynAddSubFX. As with all Yoshimi's NRPNs, the controls can be sent on any MIDI channel.

The parameters are:

- NRPN MSB sets the system/insertion effects (4 for system effects or 8 for insertion effects)

- NRPN LSB sets the number of the effect (first effect is 0)

- Data entry MSB sets the parameter number of effect to change(see below). A yoshimi extension is listed after the parameter descriptions.

- Data entry LSB sets the parameter of the effect

If the effect/parameter doesn't exists or is set to none, then the NRPN is ignored.

A full example is at the end of this file.



WARNING: Changing of some of the effect parameters produces clicks when sounds passes thru these effects. Some parameters produce clicks when they are changed very fast.

Here are the effects parameter number (for Data entry coarse).
The parameters that produces clicks have (AC) after their entry (Always Clicks).
The parameter that produces clicks only when they are changed fast have a (FC) after the entry (Fast Clicks).
Most parameters have the range from 0 to 127.
When parameters have another range, it is written as [low...high] .

Reverb

 2 - LFO Frequency
 3 - LFO Randomness
 4 - LFO Type [0..1]
 5 - LFO Stereo Difference
 6 - LFO Depth

 8 - Number of stages [0..11] (AC)
 9 - Let/Right Crossing (FC)
10 - Mode [0..1] (0=add, 1=subtract) (AC)
11 - Phase

AlienWah
~~~~~~~~
 0 - Volume or Dry/Wet (FC)
 1 - Pan (FC)
 2 - LFO Frequency
 3 - LFO Randomness
 4 - LFO Type [0..1]
 5 - LFO Stereo Difference
 6 - LFO Depth
 7 - Feedback
 8 - Delay [0..100]
 9 - Left/Right Crossing (FC)
10 - Phase

Distortion
~~~~~~~~~~
 0 - Volume or Dry/Wet (FC)
 1 - Pan (FC)
 2 - Left/Right Crossing
 3 - Drive (FC)
 4 - Level (FC)
 5 - Type [0..11]
 6 - Invert the signal (negate) [0..1]
 7 - Low Pass
 8 - High Pass
 9 - Mode [0.1] (0=mono,1=stereo)

EQ
~~
 0 - Gain (FC)

All other settings of the EQ are shown in a different way. The N represent the band ("B." setting in the UI) and the first band is 0 (and not 1), as it is shown in the UI. Change the "N" with the band you like. If you want to change a band that doesn't exist, the NRPN will be ignored.

10+N*5 - Change the mode of the filter [0..9] (AC)
11+N*5 - Band's filter frequency
12+N*5 - Band's filter gain
13+N*5 - Band's filter Q (bandwidth or resonance)
14+N*5 - reserved

Example of setting the gain on the second band:

The bands start counting from  0, so the second band is 1 => N = 1.
The formula is 12 + N * 5 => 12 + 1 * 5 = 17
So the number of effect parameter (for Data entry coarse) is 17.

DynFilter
~~~~~~~~~

 0 - Volume
 1 - Pan
 2 - LFO Frequency
 3 - LFO Randomness
 4 - LFO Type
 5 - LFO Stereo Difference
 6 - LFO Depth
 7 - Filter Amplitude
 8 - Fitler Amplitude Rate Change
 9 - Invert the signal (negate) [0..1]

Click behaviour of DynFilter not tested.



Yoshimi Extensions

If the Data MSB bit 6 is set (64) then Data LSB sets the effect type instead of a parameter number.
This must be set before making a parameter change.

0 - Off
1 - Reverb
2 - Echo
3 - Chorus
4 - Phaser
5 - AlienWah
6 - Distortion
7 - EQ
8 - DynFilter


For Insert effects, if the Data MSB bit 5 is set (32) then Data LSB sets the destination part number. 127 is off and 126 is the Master Output.

A complete example:

99 -   8 ~ insert effects
98 -   3 ~ number 4 (as displayed)
 6 -  32 ~ set destination
38 - 126 ~ Master Out
99 -   8  *
98 -   3  *
 6 -  64 ~ change effect
38 -   4 ~ Alienwah
99 -   8  *
98 -   3  *
 6 -   0 ~ Dry/Wet
38 -  30 ~ value

* these repeats are not needed as far as Yoshimi is concerned, but some sequencers get unhappy without them.


Change just a parameter on an exisiting system effect:

99 -   4 ~ system effects
98 -   0 ~ the first effect
 6 -   1 ~ Pan
38 -  75 ~ value
